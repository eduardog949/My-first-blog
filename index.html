            <p class="side-content">Believe me, as much as I wish I could stop thinking about my ex, it has turned from
              affection to obsession. The annoying part is that I am completely aware of how crazy I seem still being
              caught up on them. I did love them so much but people break up every day. Why does my situation have to be
              any different? </p>

            <p class="side-title">Hobbies</p>
            <p class="side-content">Immediatley after my break up I thought having hobbies was stupid. I believed that
              they were a waste of time, a childish past time that only made you ignore other responsibilities in life.
              Now that somebody
              time has passed, I have returned to making music for fun and coding. I understand now
              that sometimes your mind needs to be active in doing something you love, as this is what
              has helped me to get out of my head. When I work on my hobbies, I can tune out all the
              negative thoughts and just watch the time pass. Hobbies are not stupid, they are essential
              for the high paced racing mind. </p>

            <p class="actual-comment"> It's easier to miss you than to pretend to be friends on a surface level, acting
              like everything is ok.
              I feel selfish for wanting distance because I know you need a real friend right now too, but I know my
              heart won't let me be that friend at this moment.
              I'm still thinking of you every minute..every second. I let myself miss you instead of trying to forget
              you. I know we had real love, maybe it was just our lifestyles not matching up and I feel like it made us
              resent each other. If you could put us on an island, just us two with no outside influences, the love is
              there and we would be the happiest couple on earth.. Or so my mind believes right now. I have to let go of
              hope that you and I will
              end up back together.. That does not mean I would never try again, it just makes it easier on my mind to
              accept things for what they are right now. I was always in love, even when
              I tried pushing you away. I was scared and insecure and never meant to hurt you or make you
              see me in a different light. I am learning to live with my greatest mistake. It hurts me to think you
              might
              find someone else and that they will treat you better than I did.. I know, selfish of me because that
              would be amazing for you.
              It's hard to admit that I would eventually be happy for you if that was the case, but I would. I just want
              you to be happy. I hope you learn to believe in love again
              and that there is somebody perfect out there for you that treats you with respect and is incredibly
              romantic and loving.
            </p>

              lot of reflection on the last few months. I just hate how we ended up treating
              eachother after the break up.I was not a good person to you..We were not good people to eachother.
              We have now shown eachother our worst sides and it seems like our foundation was never
              really that strong since we didn't survive this..Sometimes it's hard to know if our love was
              ever real. Was drinking the only thing we had in common? Is it the only thing that kept us together?
              I still don't know if you kept certain people around because you always knew we wouldn't work out and you
              needed a backup plan just incase. These are heavy thoughts to have. I hate overthinking. Maybe these are
              normal
              thoughts to experience after a break up.

            <p class="seperate-heart-comment"> I look up at the night sky, see the shimmering stars and the image of
              your perfect skin and beautiful smile fill my brain. I wonder if you too are thinking of me, staring
              at the same sky. I stay up late knowing things are different and that your calls may never come again.
              Were we in a trance the last few months? It's scary to not feel connected to you anymore. I have become
              a lot closer with my brother and sister, calling my sister in Arizona almost every day.. It is
              to have somebody to talk to. I try not to keep anything in my head anymore, I know I feel better
              when I talk things through. I am not alone but I feel forever incomplete. I have never loved
              somebody this much, that losing them makes me sick to my stomache and unable to sleep or function.
              It isn't easy letting go. I have compiled many thoughts like this in my phone, writing down
              things whenever I feel like reaching out to you. I don't know if you will ever get the chance to
              read these or not.. Maybe its for the best, as I don't always have positive reflections. Sometimes
              my mind wants to be angry with you, as if it makes it easier to get over you.. It never does.
              If we were talking tonight I would tell you goodnight and sweet dreams..

            <p class="side-content"> I am so grateful for my job and my boss. I stayed comfortable in the same position
              for
              almost 3 years until I finally decided to take the opportunities provided to me by my boss. I now am not
              only
              the scheduling coordinator, but also float as an admission nurse and sterile processing technician! On top
              of
              learning sterile processing, I was also trained on the femto second laser and assist the doctors in
              performing
              laser cataract surgery. My boss tells me it would be nice to see me working alongside the doctors as a
              surgical technician in the operating rooms. I know this is the end game for me and I can not wait to see
              it
              all unfold.</p>

            <p class="side-content"> This song gets me everytime. My father used
              to play it every day after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. I don't know if he actually
              knew what the song was saying.. It wasn't until after he passed that I heard the singer singing
              " Your skin , yeah your skin and bones, turn into something beautiful
              and you know, you know I love you so,
              you know I love you so". Did my father resonate with being called skin n bones due to his
              detoriating body? Did he translate turning into something beautiful as dieing and
              crossing over to a better place where he would have a brand new body? Was he sublinimally
              telling me he loved me through the song since he struggled so hard to say those words
              all his life? It is funny how music can make you rationalize things. Maybe he just liked
              the melodies of the song.
